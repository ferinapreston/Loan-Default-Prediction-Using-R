# Loan Default Prediction Using R

**Goal:** Predict loan default risk using machine learning models in R.

## 🔹 Project Overview
This project develops a loan default prediction model using **XGBoost** with `caret` for hyperparameter tuning. Achieved high precision on test data.  
Data cleaning and preprocessing were performed with `dplyr`, and visualizations (feature importance, model performance) were created with `ggplot2`.

## 📊 Dataset
- Source: [Add dataset link or description here]
- Preprocessing: Missing value handling, categorical encoding, feature scaling

## ⚙️ Tech Stack
- **Language:** R
- **Libraries:** caret, xgboost, dplyr, ggplot2

## 📝 Key Steps
1. Data cleaning & feature engineering
2. Train-test split
3. Model training using XGBoost with hyperparameter tuning via caret
4. Model evaluation (precision, recall, F1-score, AUC)
5. Visualization of results

## 📈 Results
- High precision score on test data
- Feature importance plots
- Model performance curves
